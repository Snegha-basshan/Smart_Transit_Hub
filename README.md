# Smart_Transit_Hub


Smart Transit Hub is an Android application developed to help students manage daily travel by providing real-time bus availability and personalized schedules. The app ensures students can easily plan their commute according to their academic timetable while also supporting peer connectivity for safer travel.

By combining transit schedule support with a student community safety feature, this project serves as a smart mobility solution for educational institutions and contributes toward improving student transportation experiences.
